        weather information for each cell in a \u200Bdefined \u200Bgrid, for the requested
        date and time. The call defines the geo\u200Bcorners of the area and the dimensions
        of the grid (defaults to a 3x3 grid). Instead of having to calculate sample
        locations, evenly distributed, across the area, weather_grid \u200Bcalculates
        this information for you and\u200B allows you to create a rectangle and divide
        it into equally\u200B-distanced and sized cells. The weather information returned
        is identical to the above calls. Due to the \u2018square\u2019 like properties
        of the dimensions (e.g. 3 X 3), keep in mind the actual size of the rectangle
        you are asking for. In other words, a long and thin grid providing 3 x 3 cells,
        would create elongated and thin weather cells. . The aspect ratio of each
        cell is going to be the same as the grid itself. \u200BA refined, X by Y cell
