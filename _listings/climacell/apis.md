    for you and\u200B allows you to create a rectangle and divide it into equally\u200B-distanced

    Due to the \u2018square\u2019 like properties of the dimensions (e.g. 3 X 3),
    keep in mind the actual size of the rectangle you are asking for. In other words,
    a long and thin grid providing 3 x 3 cells, would create elongated and thin weather
    cells. . The aspect ratio of each cell is going to be the same as the grid itself.
