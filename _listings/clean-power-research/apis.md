  description: The service provides a tool for estimating cost savings and environmental
    benefits from renewable energy system installations. It is available both via
    a customizable web interface and a SOAP API. It accepts inputs such as the location
    of a proposed system and its likely performance parameters such as technologies
    employed, specific models and numbers of equipment to be used, and similar project
    specifications. API methods support analysis of project characteristics to generate
    estimates of economic benefits and environmental improvements. Specifications
    to be input include equipment, quantities, and costs as well as other relevant
    estimates such as natural gas prices, electric service rates, weather data source,
    and financing details. The API generates summaries of system cost and financial
    performance, expected utility bills and system cash flow, and power load along
    with reduction in emissions from conventional electricity generation.
