  description: Netatmo offers wireless thermostats and air quality measuring devices
    that can be accessed over the internet. Their Private API allows device owners
    to grant third party applications access to their devices in order to retrieve
    the data the devices have recorded. In the near future, developers will also have
    access to the Netatmo Public API, which will allow third party applications to
    retrieve data that has been marked as public by the device&#039;s owner.
